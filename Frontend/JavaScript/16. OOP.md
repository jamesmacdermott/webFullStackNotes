### Structure

We have:
Method
- Car
Its properties:
- make
- model
- color
And its methods:
- start()
- stop()
- move()

Local Storage is an object
- It has its properties such as length
- And its methods such as setItem()

### Encapsulation

Here is an object, using 'this' to widen the scope of the function and access our properties from inside the method :
```JavaScript
let employee = {
    baseSalary: 30000,
    overtime: 5,
    rate: 25,
    getOvertimeSalary2: function(){
        return this.baseSalary + this.overtime * this.rate;
    }
};

console.log("Salary:" + employee.getOvertimeSalary2())

```

- The best functions are those with no parameters

### Abstraction

- Simpler Interface
- Reduce the Impact of Change

### Inheritance

- Eliminates Redundancy
- We can have a class, such as HTMLElement
- 	With properties such as hidden, innerHTML etc.
-	And methods such as click(),focus()
- And we can apply this class to many elements, such as TextBox, CheckBox etc.

### Polymorphism


- Allows us to remove long switch statements
- With
```JavaScript 
element.render();
```
### Creating instances

- Factory Function:

```JavaScript
function createCircle(radius){ // This is called a factory function -- creates objects
    return circle = {
        radius, // Property // same as : radius: radius
        draw: function(){
            console.log('Circle Drawn')
        } // Methods
    }
}

let circle1 = createCircle(1);
let circle2 = createCircle(5);

circle2.draw();
console.log(circle1.radius);
```

- Constructor Function

```JavaScript
function Circle(radius){ // Uppercase first letter, helping to indicate class
    console.log(this); // will log our object - Circle if we have created a NEW circle, otherwise it will log the default Window object
    this.radius = radius;
    this.draw = function(){
        console.log('draw');
    }
};

const circle3 = new Circle(2);
```

#### This & New

- 'this' refers to the new object that is being created
- When the function is called with 'new' , a new object is created and 'this' is bound to that new object


- Constructor functions a better suit when there are many instances of similar objects and instanceof can be used for type checking: console.log(circle1 instanceof Circle); // true
- Factory functions help with simplicity and avoid complexity of 'this'




- Every Object has a constructor
- We can use - item.constructor to view the constructor that created the item
- Hence using circle3.constructor will return the function that is used to create Circle objects

### Altering Objects

We can add properties to an instance
- This can be done by writing syntax to change the value of a property, as if our new property we want to add already exists

```JavaScript
circle3.location = {
    x: 1,
    y: 1
}; // This creates new property Location
```

- Bracket Notation

Allows us to access properties, the name of which is a variable in the code

```JavaScript
let propertyName = 'location';
circle3[propertyName] = {
    x: 1,
    y: 1
};

- We can also delete properties

```JavaScript
delete circle3['location'];
delete circle3.radius;
```


### Iteration

We can iterate over an objects properties and methods using a for loop

```JavaScript
for (let key in circle3){
   console.log(circle3[key]);
}
```
Using bracket notation from before, we can access the value of the property

We can also only target properties:

```JavaScript
for (let key in circle3){
   if (typeof circle3[key] !=== 'function'){
      console.log(circle3[key]);
   }
}
```

And an alternative method of getting the properties & methods
```JavaScript
const keys = Object.keys(circle3); // gives all properties and methods as strings in an array

### Abstraction

- Hide the details
- Show the essentials

```JavaScript
function Circle(radius){
    this.radius = radius;
    this.defaultLocation = {
        x: 0,
        y: 0
    };
    this.computeOptimumLocation = function(){
	// ...
    }
    this.draw = function(){
        this.computeOptimumLocation();
        console.log('Drawn')
    };
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
circle.draw();
```

This code is better practice:
- computeOptimumLocation will be a complex function
- We would prefer to call a function that will run this, rather than computeOptimumLocation itself
- And if we need to add parameters to this function, all we need to change is the code within the draw function - the function that calls computeOptimumLocation

#### Private Properties and Methods

We can achieve this by making our properties and Methods private - inaccessible outside the class scope

To make the computeOptimumLocation function private, we can remove it as a method and introduce it as a local variable within our class


So our code changes to:
```JavaScript
function Circle(radius){
    this.radius = radius;
    this.defaultLocation = {
        x: 0,
        y: 0
    };
    computeOptimumLocation = function(){
	// ...
    }
    this.draw = function(){
        computeOptimumLocation();
        console.log('Drawn')
    };
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
circle.draw();
```
- Private members of the circle Object


### Getters/Setters

Sometimes we want to be able to view a private member within the rest of our code, but we don't want to be able to edit values

- We can add a new method, that gets/retrieves this value

```JavaScript
function ScopeCircle(radius){
    this.radius = radius;

    let defaultLocation = {x: 0,y: 0};
    this.getDefaultLocation = function(){
        return defaultLocation;
    }
}
```

Alternatively, we can use 

```JavaScript
Object.defineProperty(this,'defaultLocation',{ // (this, property/method Name, get/set methods)
        get: function(){
            return defaultLocation
        },
        set: function(value){
            if (!value.x || !value.y){
                throw new Error('Invalid location')
            }
            defaultLocation = value;
        }
    })
```

In order to define get and set methods
