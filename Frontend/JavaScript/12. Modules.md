We want to use modules to avoid multiple script tags
	This is because, say we have 2 js files, we cannot use multiple variables with the same name



- To fix this, we can still have our different js files, but we dont load this file with a script tag

Here is how we can link JS files together

1. Say we have 2 JS files, and i was file1 to access a variable from file2

```HTML
<script type="module" src="file1.js"></script>
<script src="file2.js"></script>
```
- Type = "Module", lets this file get variables out of other files

2. Now we must export the desired variables out of file2

```JavaScript
// file2.js
export const items = [];
// export variable as we initialise it
```

3. And then import it into file 1, the desired file we want this variable

```JavaScript
//file1.js
import {items} from '/file/path';
```
