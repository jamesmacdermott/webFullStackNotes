```JavaScript
const product = {
	name: 'sock',
	price: 5
};
console.log(product); // outputs {name:'sock', price: 5}
console.log(product.name); //outputs sock
```

```JavaScript
const drink = {
	name: 'latte',
	drinkType: 'coffee',
	price: 4.8
};
drink.price = 5; // Changes price of drink object to 5
drink.size = 'L'; // Adds a new property 'size'
delete product.drinkType; // Deletes a property
```

We can also use square brackets:

```JavaScript
const drink = {
	name: 'latte',
	drinkType: 'coffee',
	price: 4.8
};
console.log(drink['name']); // Same as drink.name
```
- Here we have name as a string
	- This means using this notation we can have properties including dashes(-) on top of combinations of strings or calculations
	- As using dot notation, JS would process this as a minus

We can also nest objects:

```JavaScript
const product2 = {
	name: 'shirt',
	'delivery-time': 2,
	rating: {
		stars: 4.5,
		count: 4000
	}
};
console.log(product2.rating.stars) // outputs 4.5

```

We can also have a function:

```JavaScript
const product2 = {
	name: 'shirt',
	'delivery-time': 2,
	func: function function1(){
	console.log('function inside object')
	} // Works as function is a type of value
};
product2.func() // Runs function
```
- Function inside object
	- = Method

### Built-in Objects

Examples Include:
- Console
- Math
- JSON
- localStorage


#### JSON

	JavaScript Object Notation
	 A syntax that can be understood by almost every       programming language.

- We use it when we send data between computers and store data

We can convert JS objects to JSON using
```JavaScript
JSON.stringify(product2); // Produces a string
```
- Note: JSON doesn't support functions

And we can convert JSON to JS using
```JavaScript
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
JSON.parse(jsonObject);
```


#### localStorage

We can save variables in local storage

```JavaScript
localStorage.setItem(*name*,*valuewewanttosave*);
localStorage.setItem('message','hello')
```
- Only supports strings

We can retrieve values from local storage with

```JavaScript
localStorage.getItem('message')
```

As only strings are supported, we tend to use 

```JavaScript

let score=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('score'));
localStorage.setItem('score',JSON.stringify(score));
```

Say we cannot get the item 'score' we can set a default value if our first value is null

```JavaScript
let score=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('score')) || 0; // Sets score to 0 if 'score' not in local storage
```

We can remove data from localStorage with:

```JavaScript
localStorage.removeItem('score');
```

However as localStorage is not very secure nor safe, we tend to not use it for key information such as passwords etc. but more so for information like:
- Theme Settings
- Layout Preferences
- Recent History
- Game Progress
- etc.

#### Auto-boxing

 ```JavaScript
.length
.startsWith('H') // Outputs boolean value
.toUpperCase()
```

##### Objects are references

```JavaScript
const object1 ={
message:'hello'

};
```
- An object is simply a reference to the data inside
	- Much like a shortcut on a computer

So say we wrote the line
```JavaScript
const object2 = object1;
```
- This means object1 is also a reference to values in object1
- This would make it so when we change object2, we are actually changing object1 also

- It also means we can change the values the object is referring to, even though object1 is defined as a constant

- In conditional statements, we compare references in this case hence 2 objects are only equal if there share references, not content inside the reference


### Shortcuts for objects

#### Destructuring
```JavaScript
const message = object4.message;
const {message} = object4; // Both these lines do the same thing (destructuring)
// we can also do
const {message,price} = object4; // to get both these values
```

#### Shorthand Property
```JavaScript
// If the property name and variable name the same
const object5= {
	message: message
};
// is equivalent to
const object5 ={
	message
};
```

#### Shorthand Method
```JavaScript
const object5 = {
	message,
	method: function function1(){
	console.log('method')
	}
};
// is equivalent to
const object5 = {
	message,
	method(){
	console.log('method');
	}
};
```
